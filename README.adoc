[abstract]
Korrel8r is a correlation engine for observability signals and observable resources. +
It can correlate multiple domains, diverse signals, inconsistent labeling, and varied data stores.

CAUTION: Korrel8r is still in early development. There are no compatibility guarantees between versions.


The goals of this project include:

* Encode domain knowledge from SREs and other experts as re-usable _rules_.
* Automate navigation from symptoms to data that helps diagnose causes.
* Connect data from diverse types of store, with different schema.
* Reduce multiple-step manual procedures to fewer clicks or queries.
* Help tools that gather and analyze diagnostic data to focus on relevant information.
