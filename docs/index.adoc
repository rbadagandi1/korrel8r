Korrel8r is a correlation engine for Kubernetes objects. It provides a REST API for running correlation queries, by using a set of rules that relate objects.

Given a _start_ object, korrel8r searches for a chain of related rules, and finds other related objects. Related objects can be in multiple different back-end stores, and can be encoded using multiple different schemas. Korrel8r can also show the _neighbourhood_ of all data related to an object of interest.

Korrel8r can be deployed service inside the cluster, or run as an executable outside the cluster connecting to the API server and stores inside the cluster.
