= About rules

Rules express relationships between classes, possibly in different domains.

A Rule applies to an object of a _start_ class, and generates a query for a _goal_ class.
The start and goal can be in different domains (e.g. `k8s:Pod` â†’ `log:application`)

A rule definition contains a _template_ that uses the vocabulary of the _start domain_ and  generates a _query_ in the vocabulary of the _goal domain_.
Rules are bridge between domains different vocabularies, schema, labels and query languages.
