TIP: Make sure you have xref:installing-korrel8r-ocp.adoc#installing-korrel8r-ocp[installed Korrel8r]

. Refresh the web console
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Logs*. Click the *Metrics* link to see correlated metrics of each log record.
. Navigate to *Observe* -> *Alerting*, and click an alert. Alerts that have related logs have a *see related logs* link.

[TIP]
====
Not all alerts have a *see related logs* link.
Only alerts that are _related_ to container workloads can have related logs.
For example, `KubePodCrashLooping` is related to a Pod and so can have related logs.
See the xref:FAQ.adoc#no-related-logs[FAQ] for more.
