[id="objects-signal-types_{context}"]
== Signal types

A Kubernetes cluster generates many types of _signals_, including the following:

[width="100%",cols="21%,79%",options="header",]
|===
|Signal Type |Description
|Metrics |Counts and measurements of system behavior.

|Alerts |Rules that fire when metrics cross important thresholds.

|Logs |Application, infrastructure and audit logs from pods and cluster
nodes.

|Kubernetes events |Describe significant events in a cluster.

|Traces |Nested execution spans describing distributed requests.

|Network events |TCP and IP level network information.
|===

[id="objects-resource-types_{context}"]
== Resource types

A cluster also contains _resources_ which are not generally considered to be signals,
but that can be correlated with signals and other objects. Examples of resources include:

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|Resource Type |Description
|k8s resources |Spec and status information.
|Run books |Problem solving guides associated with Alerts.
|k8s probes |Information about resource state.
